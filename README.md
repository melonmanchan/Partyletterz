Make your websites party hard!!!! See the example folder for usage, and the src folder for party requirements (particularly the image files).

Just include the css and js files, add the 'partyletterz' class to the h1, h2, h3 or p elements you want to stylize, and initialize with partyLetterz.partyHard();
